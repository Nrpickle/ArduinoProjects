# ArduinoProjects


A repo for miscellaneous multi-purpose Arduino Projects. These are a group of small projects that didn't fit anywhere else. They are listed along with a short description.

These projects come with no provided support or warranty, but I'd be happy to answer any quick questions you have. <a href="mailto:nick@nickmccomb.net">Email me</a> and I'll get back to you.
